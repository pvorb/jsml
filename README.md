JSML
====

Appendable sequences of JSON documents

There’s an issue with JSON that I can’t tolerate: If you want to add a new
object to a JSON document, you have to rewrite the whole document. That makes it
inappropriate for logging an similar tasks. This is where JSML pitches in.

Example
-------

Here’s an example document that defines metadata for serveral articles:

``` javascript
{
  "title": "Hello World",
  "date":  "2012-08-09",
  "tags":  [ "hello world", "misc" ]
}
---
{
  "title": "The second article",
  "date":  "2012-08-10",
  "tags":  [ "misc" ]
}
```

Note that each object is a normal JSON representation of a JavaScript object.
In JSON itself, the same document would look like this:

``` javascript
[
  {
    "title": "Hello World",
    "date": "2012-08-09",
    "tags": [ "hello world", "misc" ]
  },
  {
    "title": "The second article",
    "date":  "2012-08-10",
    "tags":  [ "misc" ]
  }
]
```

So the only difference from a usual JSON document is, that objects in top level
arrays are separated by `---` on a distinct line.

Installation
------------

```
npm install jsml
```

or

```
ender build jsml
```

Usage
-----

You can use JSML just like [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON):

``` javascript
var JSML = require('jsml');

var jsmlDocument = '{ "title": "Hello World",\n'
                 + '"date":  "2012-08-09",\n'
                 + '"tags":  [ "hello world", "misc" ] }\n'
                 + '---\n'
                 + '{ "title": "The second article",\n'
                 + '"date":  "2012-08-10",\n'
                 + '"tags":  [ "misc" ] }\n';

// Parse a string

var doc = JSML.parse(jsmlDocument);

console.log(doc);

// Stringify an Object or an Array of Objects

var jsmlString = JSML.stringify(doc, null, '  ');

console.log(jsmlString);
```

This will print:

``` javascript
[ { title: 'Hello World',
    date: '2012-08-09',
    tags: [ 'hello world', 'misc' ] },
  { title: 'The second article',
    date: '2012-08-10',
    tags: [ 'misc' ] } ]
```

for the parsed string and the following for the _stringified_ array:

``` javascript
{
  "title": "Hello World",
  "date": "2012-08-09",
  "tags": [
    "hello world",
    "misc"
  ]
}
---
{
  "title": "The second article",
  "date": "2012-08-10",
  "tags": [
    "misc"
  ]
}
```
